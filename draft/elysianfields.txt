elysian field

november peels off the skin of the road 

i sweat through a polyp snowfield 
which i must annihilate

too much rests on the left spine glowing in the dark

beyond the paling fence
the 2mm hole in the world

------------------------------------------------

elysian field ii

back before closing at the
mass subsidiary zone

dust yoked to 
ghost

backlit in blue

i was caught weeping 
a flashlight with flesh batteries

red dust of morning
if main street burns

------------------------------------------------

elysian field iii

mountains sag 
out of the sea
            stillborn                                  

dust yokes to 
                              exile

spectral fog erupts
grateful eyes bow

november peels me open like an orange

i must   annihilate
beyond the pale freeze
